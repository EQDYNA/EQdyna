# EQdyna  

A parallel Finite Element software to model earthquake spontaneous dynamic ruptures. The software is designed to use high-performance computing. It is written in FORTRAN 90 and MPI.

## Features

EQdyna is based on Finite Element Method of solid mechanics and features 
1) 3D under-integrated hexahedral elements stabilized by hourglass control; 
2) explicit central difference time integration for efficient and accurate modeling of wave propagation; 
3) the traction-at-split-node technique to model earthquake faults or fractures;
4) the perfectly matched layer absorbing boundary;
5) the coarse-grained Q model for attenuation of seismic waves;
6) various forms of friction laws including slip-weakening, time-weakening, rate- and state- friction with the aging law, slip law and dynamic weakening;
7) 3D MPI. 

## Initializing environments and compiling on ADA, Texas A&M University, HPC.

```
Module load intel/2018a
make # run makefile to complie EQdyna. An excutable file eqdyna-hyb will be generated. 
```

## Batch file preparation on ADA

Here is an example of the batch file, runeqdyna.txt to submit jobs on ADA. The key word is #BSUB and contexts after # is commented. 

```
#BSUB -J job.name

## send stderr and stdout to the same file 
#BSUB -o mpitest.%J

## login shell to avoid copying env from login session
## also helps the module function work in batch jobs
#BSUB -L /bin/bash

## 4 hours of walltime ([HH:]MM)
#BSUB -W 04:00

#BSUB -n 72 -M 2700    # 72: total number of cores allocated to the job
#BSUB -R rusage[mem=2700] span[ptile=12] 
# mem: the memory allocated to each core
# span[ptile]: the number of cores used on each computing node

# load intel toolchain
ml intel/2018a
ml
export OMP_NUM_THREADS=1

mpirun -np 72 ./eqdyna-hyb # excuting EQdyna
```

## Job submission on ADA
After submission, the job will be quened and excuated when resources are avalible.
```
Bsub <runeqdyna.txt
```

## Postporcessing

1) run rtp3DMPI.m to plot rupture time contour.
It coverts results frt.txt* to cplot.txt.  
2) run timeanalysis.m to analyze computational times used by various modules.
It processes timeinfo* files.
